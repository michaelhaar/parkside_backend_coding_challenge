# Parkside Robo-Dance Coding Challenge (Backend) ðŸ¤–

## Introduction

This repository was part of my job application process at [Parkside](https://www.parkside-interactive.com/) and contains a simple REST API that shows my current skills and talent as well as my preferred work style. I was asked to built the backend for a **Robo-Dance** competition app.

## Overview

Robots love dancing and regularly battle each other in fabulous dance competitions. Goal of the project was to design a API for a Robo-Dance competition app in a way that a frontend application could consume it. Therefore I created two API endpoints with the following features:

- **/robots**

  - add a robot
  - receive a individual robot
  - receive all robots
  - (data is stored in a persisted data source)

- **/danceoffs**
  - store a danceoff result
  - store multiple danceoff results with a single request
  - receive all danceoffs
  - receive a specific danceoff

Please checkout the [original project description from Parkside](docs/Parkside_Coding_Challenge_Backend.pdf) for more information.
